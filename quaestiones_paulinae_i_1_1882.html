<p><em>The need to revise the foundations of our knowledge about the original
Paulinism.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a long time now I have been intensely occupied by one particular question.
It is this one: what is the reason that the first four of our canonical Pauline
epistles have escaped the skeptical eye of criticism? Or: when in a few
exceptional cases they had been brought under suspicion, why did the objections
that were made against their authenticity have so little impact, or why at
least were they not taken into consideration? After a long investigation I have
arrived at a somewhat satisfactory answer for myself, but until I could receive
the opinion of qualified reviewers I have remained in a state of continuous
tension which has progressively become more difficult for me to bear. The only
way for me to resolve it is by public discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I proceed to do this now it is not without some hesitation, although I am
fully conscious that only scholarly motives have driven me to take this step.
There was no impulse for me to discuss this topic in public as long as my
answer to the stated question was derived from or at least completely matched
the opinion which has broadly been embraced by modern critics. But that answer
doesn&#8217;t satisfy me any longer. I can&#8217;t accept the prevailing opinion anymore. I
cannot continue to tell myself that the authenticity of the four Pauline
Hauptbriefe has not yet been investigated deliberately, has not yet been
subjected to a serious and versatile criticism, because they carry the
unmistakable hallmarks of authenticity on them and within themselves. Continued
research has drawn my attention to facts and phenomena that make their presumed
authenticity appear most improbable. The first feeling that came to me was one
of astonishment, and this astonishment was more prone to make me speechless
rather than voluble, at least for the wider public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Tune solus sapiens?</em> I thought with Luther, and this thought made me cautious,
drove me to renewed and increasingly extensive investigations. I considered it
to be my duty to reexamine completely the foundations on which my belief in the
authenticity of the epistles was built. I reviewed the course that the
scholarly investigation into the Pauline epistles had taken since Semler and
especially since Baur, until in the end, as I have said, I arrived at a
somewhat satisfactory solution. I started to see, at least to a certain extent,
why the authenticity hypothesis concerning the four Hauptbriefe could have
retained the character of an axiom for so long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My confidence was increased by the insight I had gained in the history of this
part of Biblical criticism, and further considerations then strengthened my
resolve to publish the results I had obtained. Firstly, my results had slowly
grown in size and significance&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;so I believed&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and thus my reasoning had
increased in power and clarity. Secondly, around my negative conclusion
eventually emerged a background of positive historical data which, it appeared
to me, could become a stimulus towards a renewed and promising investigation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But first specialists would have to become convinced that such an investigation
undertaken on a new and broader scale can now truly be considered worthwhile.
There indeed appears to be no interest in this. On the contrary, even in modern
circles it appears everyone agrees that the question of the authenticity of the
four Pauline Hauptbriefe is not a topic worthy of consideration: maybe not
ever, and definitely not in the near future. I can hear them say it now: What
is the purpose of this investigation? Are we so lacking in important questions
that we have to go look for superfluous work? You don&#8217;t have to investigate
what we already know. Did not Baur in his criticism of the New Testament and
more particularly in the field of the Pauline epistles reach the outer
boundaries of what could be put into question?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, a sole renegade like Bruno Bauer did dare to cross that boundary; but
he has been paid so little attention in the thirty years that have passed since
his attack against the authenticity of the Hauptbriefe that he would almost be
happy to discover that in the introduction of the newest publication of Meyer&#8217;s
Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> men of the trade still
consider it worthwhile to highlight his undertaking with the qualification
"'sacrilegious'" . Even our compatriot Dr. A. Pierson, the only one who as far
as I know has at least incidentally raised his voice against the authenticity
of the Epistle to the Galatians, decided to ignore the work of this predecessor
from Berlin. Dr. Pierson himself appears to await such a fate, if indeed one
can go by the categorical way in which almost immediately after the publication
of his critical study a negative verdict has been delivered about his attack
against what has until this present day remained indisputable. When one of his
reviewers, Dr Prins, deliberately picked this one part of Pierson&#8217;s treatise,
i.e. his attack against the Epistle to the Galatians, it was evidently not
difficult for the professor from Leiden to defend the old stronghold. His
apologia: &#8220;de Brief van Paulus aan de Galatiërs gehandhaafd,&#8221; Leiden 1879,
was completely unlike an anxious struggle. Here was no question of a seriously
battered fortress where to break the siege an army and campaign was needed; a
surgical strike, which might also turn out to be a final blow, would be
sufficient to drive back an enemy unsupported by troops or materiel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although in my review of Dr. Pierson&#8217;s book in the Theologisch Tijdschrift of
1879 I had to admit that this scholar had pointed out various gaps in our
understanding of Paul and the original Christianity, I also had to conclude (on
page 185 and following): "As long as Dr. Pierson supplies no better grounds for
his opinion we are obligated to maintain the authenticity (of the Epistle to
the Galatians)." In the same issue Dr. A. H. Blom considered Prins' assertion
of the authenticity of the Epistle to the Galatians against the concerns of Dr.
Pierson. Again the same conclusion&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the Paul of dr. Pierson is a caricature:
"if the matter wasn&#8217;t so serious, one could easily have thought that Pierson&#8217;s
goal was to demonstrate his skill at defending a hopeless position" (page 285).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So this little cloud has drifted by us. We again rejoice at the sight of a
clear blue sky in which the sun shines delightfully so that no one feels the
thought arise: where does the light in which I walk come from, where does the
warmth that refreshes me originate? With all our heart we agree with Baur&#8217;s
statement (<em>der Apostel Paulus</em>, 2ste Ausg. page 276 and 1st Ausg. page 248):
"Against the authenticity of these four epistles (Romans, 1st and 2nd
Corinthians and Galatians) not even the slightest suspicion has been raised as
they bear the character of Pauline originality so incontrovertibly that it is
unthinkable that any critical doubt could be asserted against them." We agree
with the judgment of Renan, when in his introduction in his St. Paul he
summarizes the four Hauptbriefe as in being the class of "incontestable and
uncontested" and does not consider it necessary to justify this classification
with even a single word.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would not be difficult to multiply these two testimonials with a great deal
of others that sound no less certain and decided as evidence of the unanimity
that at present holds sway among scholars concerning the authenticity of the
four Hauptbriefe.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> One must therefore ask: what happened to make
us consider a question which has so clearly proved not to be in question? I owe
my readers an explanation especially since not long ago I have made
reassurances concerning this matter of authenticity. I have to supply the
reasons that moved me to urge a revision of this judgment even though I
appeared to declare only recently that it had been concluded to the
satisfaction of all dispassionate and thinking people. Again: what happened?
The few pages that my colleague A. Pierson dedicated to his attack on the
authenticity of the Epistle to the Galatians <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> did not convince me. I am
completely aware of this. But I want to admit openly that I received the first
impulse to my current investigation from him. Although I could not fully accept
his fresh and original considerations, they awoke in me concerns that slowly
grew in number and weight and eventually took on a form that was clear and
determined enough to be shared with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should someone want to decide from my admission above that my present opinion
is unsound or that the results of historical criticism are insecure in general,
I would like to remind them that the value of any results obtained can only be
measured by the value of the method that was applied, as well as the
applicability of said method to a given problem. Against the appearance of
rashness I would also urge not to neglect the probability or at least the
possibility that I would not have changed my views so drastically before I
demonstrated to myself after thorough investigation that what I had assumed in
the past could not be sustained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the situation in which I find myself. I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s not more than
an illusion to imagine we&#8217;re on solid historical ground with the Paul of the
Hauptbriefe. This supposedly settled fact is in reality unknown. This Paul is a
psychological riddle if we place him so close in time to Jesus. The final
outcomes of critical investigation cannot be integrated into a proper whole
with the results we have obtained about the original Paulinism. And once again
one searches in vain for a way to put the apostolic Christianity that emerges
from the haze in a correct historical relation to the earliest Gnosticism. Add
to this that the picture of the historical Jesus, the circle of early Apostles
and the genesis of the so-called gospel of Peter have become increasingly hazy,
and therefore that the origin of Paulinism has become increasingly insecure to
us, and it will be acknowledged that it need not be ingratitude that makes us
long for more light when we consider the oldest gospel and its evangelists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No, let&#8217;s admit to it honestly: our situation is not healthy. We indeed do not
want back that which Tübingen criticism discarded as untenable. Its negations
are our own negations as well. But it also affirmed. It started to build on the
ground that it cleared of debris and ruins, and it continues to do so
assiduously. But whoever claims that this work is progressing well is certainly
not a very demanding person. On me at least these modern construction workers
give the impression that they have a brick of masonry in one hand but don&#8217;t
have trowel and lime in the other but instead still carry a crowbar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, shall I say it: from the days of Strauss to the present we moderns have
obtained nothing but negative results in the field of historical investigation
into Christian origins. The founder of the school itself, Ferdinand Christian
Baur, never attempted to establish a biography of Jesus. His classic work about
Paul, although excellent in every other way, lacks the key capacity to let us
understand the hero in the context of his own time. Baur did not attempt to
lift the veil behind which the writers of the New Testament tried to keep
hidden the original Christianity. Did he, lacking reliable sources, despair of
penetrating to the true facts of what caused the pre-Pauline faith in the
resurrection of the Lord? Or did he consider it unwise to share his opinion
about this in a straightforward manner at this risky juncture? Enough: as long
as the community in which Paul was cured from his Judaism so that he could
zealously work as a Christian remained completely covered by the mysterious
mantle of its faith in the resurrection; as long as the environment in which
the great apostle to the gentiles acted kept itself hidden in the haze of
mythology, it could not be said that historical criticism had accomplished its
task concerning the founders of Christianity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Theodorus Keim has departed from us as well without having explained to us the
essence of origin of Christianity. I can&#8217;t say whether others have been happier
than I in retrieving much of historical value from the long and tiresome
deliberations of this author about the resurrection of Jesus. But I consider it
decided that the silence of the master, Baur, was better than the speech of the
student, Keim.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shall we then follow the example of the Tübingen scholar and keep our silence
as well, and avoid making a choice between the two options that are proposed:
the physical or the psychological miracle at the birth of the Christian
community? What shall I say? I think we moderns cannot continue to stay silent
as Baur was, as in this case it would be equivalent to dithering. I think the
time to speak has arrived. I myself am certain of it: as long as the Paul of
the Hauptbriefe stands before us like a man of flesh and blood, we cannot ever
construct a picture of the Christian community that existed before him, nor of
the teacher that had brought it together that answers the demands of our
historical conscience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Did Ernest Renan then write his seven parts of "l&#8217;histoire des origines du
christianisme" for nothing? I will be the last to diminish the extraordinary
talents and accomplishments of this author, but I won&#8217;t follow him when he
declares about himself that he and he alone was the suitable person to give us
a correct picture of primitive Christianity and its founder. Looking back on
the long series of studies spent investigating this important topic, as well as
a consideration of the many contradictions that exist within them, should have
raised in Renan the desire to revise his work from the beginning so that he
could create a more coherent whole. Now that he has instead started a
completely different work <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup> there is little chance
that this scholar will give us a more satisfactory answer in the near future to
the main question that keeps us occupied here. I mean this one: how do we
explain the transition from the pre-Pauline to the Pauline phase in Christian
theology when we hold the Hauptbriefe to be authentic? It would not be
difficult for me to show that Renan&#8217;s view of Paul&#8217;s personality does not
contain the desired answer, and that he has not been successful in giving us a
clear and self-consistent picture of the Christian environment in which the
apostle to the gentiles acted. For the moment it is enough to note two
particulars. Firstly, Renan is forced to declare that the peculiarity of Paul&#8217;s
person consisted of the combination of mutually contradictory
qualities.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup> Secondly, the conclusion to
his investigation concerning the Epistle to the Galatians is that the dispatch
of this epistle to its destination can only be explained when we imagine the
writer to be in a state of acute excitement which prevented him from
calculating the consequences of this odd, indeed, incomprehensible,
act.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If one summarizes all which Renan has said about the two heroes of primitive
Christianity, about "le doux Jésus" and "l&#8217;incomparable Apôtre", one feels
involuntarily inclined to ask: does the author himself believe the reality, the
historical reality, of the figures that he portrays in such a way for us? Art,
undeniable art was required to model these figures, but the question is
allowed, is urged upon us: is the material homogeneous? As far as I am concerned
I do not doubt to answer this question in the negative and I dare to predict:
let weather and wind, let rain and sunshine work on them for a while longer and
these cleanly polished and elegantly formed sculptures will fall apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Endlessly more benefit I expect from the tough patience and iron diligence of
those scholars who try to create an accurate picture of the time of Jesus and
Paul from more reliable sources, even though for the time being they have
barely dared to sketch the primary figures themselves. Yes, I consider it
entirely typical for this phase of our historical inquiry that <em>New Testament
History</em> has started to take its place as a dedicated field of study alongside
<em>Life of Jesus</em> and <em>History of the Apostolic Age</em>, alongside <em>New Testament
Theology</em> and <em>Christian Archaeology</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am deeply convinced that this field of historical labour will only be right
and healthy when we shall be able to account entirely for the grounds of our
faith in the historicity of both persons on which, as if on foundation piles,
the whole building of ancient Christianity appears to be resting&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Jesus and
Paul. They still represent to us names with historical reality; we can imagine
that they who we refer to with these names are still the same as they who in
our childhood we gave the tribute of our solemn, almost idolizing worship. But
with some reflection we have to acknowledge that along with the holy nimbus
that enveloped those honorable figures in the past also many another
peculiarity that distinguished them has fallen away for us, so that both those
names in truth now call up entirely different images in our mind than in the
past.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Criticism, continuing its work of sifting and separating assiduously, has wiped
out one by one the Johannine features in the Jesus of our imagination, and
likewise in the Paul of our imagination removed many a feature obtained from
Luke. We didn&#8217;t stop there. We also had to remove the majority of the synoptic
Jesus as ornaments added afterwards to the founder of Christianity. Likewise we
had to bring the original theology of Paul down to rather more simple
proportions and within more modest boundaries. Will we continue along this road
of simplification or will we pause for a moment and looking around ask
ourselves the question with greater seriousness than before: what of Jesus and
Paul themselves remains for us in this history of the New Testament? Is it not
as if the frame is becoming ever wider, increasingly rich in decorations, while
the images that it encloses gradually lose their luster and expression?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our investigation of the origin of Christianity the power of scientific
consequence has been spreading for a long time now from the gospels to the
Pauline Hauptbriefe. Will we be able to disguise for much longer that the Jesus
who we at long last encounter in these Hauptbriefe does not in any way match
the expectation that the extended critical investigation of the synoptic
gospels has given us to understand about his person? Won&#8217;t the truth finally
jump out at us that with these Hauptbriefe we find ourselves chronologically at
a greater distance from the birth of Christianity than with the oldest
components of our synoptics? Or should we say: "it is not allowed to make a
determination about the chronological order of such disparate documents unless
it is shown that the documents under comparison have emerged in the same
environment"? But can&#8217;t we see that the Paul of the Hauptbriefe is even more
difficult to explain in the context of Jesus' contemporaries and friends in
which he is placed than the Jesus of the synoptics where he acts as teacher
among the Jewish people? Don&#8217;t we see that this synoptic Jesus still wears more
of the local color of the land in which he is placed than the Jesus who lives
in the awareness of the the author of the Hauptbriefe?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do I fool myself or have we been deaf until now to the great lesson that the
dedicated practice of the history of the New Testament has preached to us: the
fact that the Jewish documents do not contain anything which makes us suspect
that between the year 30 and 70 events took place in Palestine which according
to the witness of the New Testament should have caused a great excitement in
all hearts there? When we take a careful look at the course which the critical
investigation of the synoptic gospels has taken; when we in particular pay
attention to the increasingly widely accepted notion that these gospels only
took the form in which we posses them now around halfway through the second
century; when we further consider that this canonical form must have been
preceded by a series of earlier forms of which the oldest is not much earlier
than the end of the first century: then it becomes clear to us that the
synoptic tradition could take shape and develop in such a way without much firm
and precise data from the time before 70 at its root. It becomes comprehensible
that we hear the synoptic Jesus speak at times with the perspective of those
who had experienced the great catastrophe in the year 70.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But in this way it&#8217;s shown to us as well how careful we have to be when we make
use of these gospels to try to determine the events in Palestine that took
place forty years earlier. If we have in the Jewish writings of the first
century a fairly complete picture of the political and religious situation in
Palestine during that time, then we are forced to declare that the impression
of the situation that the New Testament and in particular the synoptic and
Pauline literature give us cannot have been taken from reality. More carefully
than before we have to take into account the background that is implied by the
Hauptbriefe. When in them we find ourselves placed in a world of specifically
Christian communal life with clearly expressed forms of richly developed
theological thought, we should not forcefully push back the thought of a
possible later origin of the epistles. Of course we are still obligated to
provide the evidence that a later dating of these epistles is not blocked by
substantial objections. In other words, we need to show that we can give these
epistles a place in a later period: the post-Apostolic age.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bruno Bauer has already tried, as is known, to provide this evidence in
1850-1852. His criticism of the Pauline Hauptbriefe reminds us of what happened
with the Probabilia of Bretschneider about the gospel of John in the year 1820.
If we take into account the quality of the latter work we have to declare
without hesitation: these Probabilia deserved a better reception than they
received in the first 25 years, even from impartial scholars. But who can blame
Bretschneider&#8217;s contemporaries that they did not let themselves be immediately
convinced of the unsustainability of the generally shared opinion on the gospel
of John? Did not the author of this modest polemic submit his booklet to the
critical judgment of his colleagues with a certain anxious reservation and
without an appearance of self-confidence? Moreover, did he not soon after
publication retract his Probabilia as guesses that were too bold and entirely
unsatisfactorily motivated?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As far as Bruno Bauer is concerned: he has certainly not retracted any of his
suggested objections, more so, he has rather given the evidence of his
unchanged view in this, although only through sparse communications. On the
other hand he has done little or nothing to supply further explanation that
would give his schematic and cursory treatise more substance and significance.
This way, in our view, his criticism gradually received the same character of
prematurity as did the criticism of the gospel of John before the time of
F.C. Baur. One can think of three reasons to explain the smaller influence of
Bruno Bauer&#8217;s work. Firstly the attack on the authenticity of these epistles of
Paul had not been prepared by previous criticism, while even at the end of the
last century concerns had already been expressed about the fourth
gospel.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup> Secondly Bruno Bauer&#8217;s criticism severely
lacked the recommendation of a nice manner that so pleasantly distinguished
Bretschneider&#8217;s booklet.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_8" title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup> Finally
the method applied appeared to be of a kind that did not promise a profitable
discussion to any scholarly opponents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s consider this last and most important point for a moment. In which way is
Bruno Bauer&#8217;s method peculiar? Indeed this author does proceed in an unabashed
manner that&#8217;s as astonishing as it is entertaining. He simply assumes, or
should I say decrees, the spuriousness of all New Testament documents and in
particular all of the Pauline epistles. Armed with this hypothesis as if it&#8217;s
the clearest magnifying glass, he goes through the documents he discusses so he
can specifically occupy you with thoughts and expressions which appear to be
useful in the interest of proving them spurious. Without question this new
light in which he shows you these old documents is highly surprising.
Continuously you exclaim: but I had never read that in my Paul! Often however
this criticism gives you the impression of gruff contrarianism; too often the
style of argument appears partial. The irregularities in the style and
argumentation of Paul take on the appearance of insurmountable obstacles; the
contradictions and inconsistencies expand to nonsensical non sequiturs; the
apostle becomes in turn a thoughtless declaimer and an insufferable hierarch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand in this merciless critic you miss what you would look for in
the first place: for example the evidence that the epistles are not consistent
with their presumed circumstances; that such a Paul cannot be understood at
such a short distance to the life of Jesus, and so on. You also look in vain
for the explanation of the course of the old Christian life and thought as a
whole, with an indication of how these pseudepigraphs fit in the writings of
the early Christian era. In short this criticism is too dialectical and
polemical, too negatively skeptical, too subjectively arbitrary. And no wonder!
The author did not consider it useful to explain to you how this Paulinism
relates to the original Christianity, how it arose from it, and how it connects
to the later old-Catholic literary-ecclesiastical movement. Just as little did
he discuss the contemporaneous development of thought and ideals in the Jewish
world so that he did not even investigate how the theology of the Hauptbriefe
relates to that of Alexandrian and Palestinian Judaism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you let yourself be lead by him, then it is as if you are transported from a
well-known and hospitable place into savage wilds under an open sky, where it&#8217;s
impossible to orient yourself. It&#8217;s not a tempting prospect. You would fear
that what awaits you there will hardly outweigh that which your haughty guide
forces you to give up. This is why you&#8217;re unwilling to listen to his
discourses, which after all only betray their intent to raise in you a certain
spirit of general skepticism, and to spoil your enjoyment of many a document
from antiquity which has thus far been highly treasured. With a "Begone,
Satan!" you say goodbye to this unsympathetic critic, determined to pay
attention to him no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But have we thereby done full justice to this opponent of the canonical Paul? I
don&#8217;t believe so. I myself don&#8217;t regret having taken up and thoroughly examined
this seemingly settled case again, this so-called stillborn product of
hypercriticism. Along with Pierson&#8217;s remarks about the first two chapters of
the Epistle to the Galatians that we have repeatedly mentioned before, Bruno
Bauer&#8217;s concerns have alerted me to a thus far much neglected side of the
historical problem that is presented to us in the Pauline epistles. I paid
special attention to what I would like to call the actuality, or also the real
situation, or background reality of these epistles. I tried to understand the
epistles as letters&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is as a means of practicing community between a
certain writer and his particular readers. Above all I attempted to
characterize the personal affairs and relations that were implied and described
here. When I had in this way designed a vivid image of the reality in which
these documents place us, I then compared this reality with the data supplied
to me by other sources about the moral-religious life in the Jewish world
during the time in which the historical Paul lived and worked. And each time
the conclusion of my consideration was that our canonical Pauline epistles do
not belong in this period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I continuously had to ask myself this question: why had my predecessors, with
the exception of Bruno Bauer and A. Pierson, arrived at a completely different
result and had stuck to it? I obtained mainly this answer: they had assumed the
extraordinary as rule and the remarkable as touchstone, because they moved in a
vicious circle. They sought to simultaneously explain what was extraordinary in
the person of Paul by what was extraordinary about his time and environment,
and conversely what was extraordinary about the time of Paul by the
extraordinary genius of the personality of Paul. I express perhaps myself more
clearly when I say: they did not look seriously for an explanation as they were
used to taking the extraordinary as self-evident and natural&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;indeed as the
only thing thinkable and possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the field of historical investigation as well as in the physical sciences we
are always exposed to the danger of searching for leverage on the uncertain
ground of an axiom that is nothing more than an insufficiently examined
tradition or hypothesis. And twice greater is this danger when we deal with
so-called sacred history and we come into contact with persons or events that
in our circle are always to be approached with special reverence. This
reverence of many is to us an imposing power and we do not call into question
its legitimacy without special reason. And yet, our respect for this power
should stay within boundaries. After all it is a great error to think that the
discovery of a literary fiction in the area of so-called sacred history would
be harmful to the religious faith which should be dear to us above all as one
of the most precious parts of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Small and narrow-minded souls have shaken at the thought of the loss that they
would suffer if their faith in the historical reality of the Jesus of the
gospel of John were taken away. Small and narrow-minded souls shiver and
shudder when they eventually come to learn that it is not much better with
faith in the reality of the synoptic Jesus. For a long time Tübingen criticism
was condemned as a contamination dangerous to piety for its rejection of the
great majority of the Pauline epistles, and was avoided by most Christian
theologians. What will happen if they hear that not only the fatherly friend
and pleasant counselor of the Pastoral epistles, not only the gallant and smug
dogmatic of the other Deutero-Pauline epistles, but also the eminently
important and vibrant figure who speaks to us from the Pauline Hauptbriefe
cannot be something other than the product of ecclesiastical forgery? Certainly
then we will, at least in the beginning, hear nothing but "boundless skepticism
and criminal hypercriticism!" Even among liberal scholars we won&#8217;t lack for
those who will observe this iconoclasm with concern and speak, shaking their
heads, about the lack of piety for the heroes of Christian antiquity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the cloud of dismay will pass. Careful judgment will gain the upper hand.
The hero cult will be cleansed of that which was exaggerated and one-sided. Our
religious faith will gain from knowledge of antiquity. The historical reality
cleared from fiction and appearances will serve us better in our striving for
the highest ideals than the sweetest illusions and the prejudices that are most
appealing to our imagination. Finally it will be clear to us that Christianity
was not created by the few persons glorified into half-gods who are described
as its founders by the scripture of our Christian church, but by the united
forces of many pious and noble people whose true history was never described
and after all, has remained until now almost entirely unknown to us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Substantial progress in our knowledge of the origin of Christianity can only
take place when in our investigation of the sources we follow the example of
painters who, to get a proper impression of the effect of their artwork,
regularly break off their work and take a few steps away from their canvas so
that they can see the piece they are creating from a greater distance. When we
stand too close to the figures that are portrayed in the New Testament and when
we immerse ourselves too much in their individual and personal aspects, we will
pass by a lot of what distinguishes them as types embedded in that time, and in
that people, and in that cultural and religious context&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that which is is the
most important for our knowledge of history. When we regularly shift our
perspective when we reconstruct a scene in our mind, we will be better able to
understand these heroes. Only this way we can develop critical adroitness.
Without it, we cannot make judgments with any certainty about the historical
veracity of our New Testament documents. Without it, we cannot decrease the
power of tradition over us to its proper proportions. So often have we thought
that New Testament criticism had reached the outer borders of negation and that
what was left as undisputed could be considered safe as a solid ground to
construct the building of our historical knowledge of Christian origins, until
continued investigation convinced us that this negation should be pushed
further.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is how it went with the investigation of the Pauline Hauptbriefe. The
information about Paul collected in the New Testament made it necessary to
separate and distinguish more reliable documents from less reliable ones. But
once the choice between derived and direct, between forged and authentic
document had been made, the value of that which was found to be genuine and
proven was felt more strongly and was more difficult to call into question.
Where voices like that of Straatman at home and of Weisse abroad spoke of
extensive interpolation and thus hinted of forgery in these genuine Pauline
epistles, most of us felt more shock and dismay than actual interest in truly
getting acquainted with the concerns that what were advanced. The idea that it
was allowed to slash around with pruning knife in these sacred woods and groves
as freely as in the lush jungle of secular writers was certainly annoying. It
seemed to us that these presumed emendations only arose from misestimation of
the completely extraordinary in form and content which distinguished the
products of this entirely unique and original mind. Did it make sense to apply
the touchstone of normal style and conventional logic where everything gave
evidence of great and elevated conceptions? Was it not evidence of a petty
argumentativeness to want to remove irregularities when they were unbreakably
connected to the genius of this deep thinker, of this driven hero of faith?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what does this whole argument come down to, looking at it properly? This
Paul, we used to think, was an entirely extraordinary man and that&#8217;s why he is
not bound, in his thought and acts or in his letter-writing, by the laws that
apply to ordinary humans. If here and there the jumps in his reasoning seem
noticeably sudden and precarious, the transitions in mood and emotions abrupt
and peculiar: no wonder! That&#8217;s typically Paul, after all. But when we see
unusual motives in other writers we do not reject a priori the possibility of
interpolation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Equipped with such tools, it&#8217;s incredible how far one can get in the
explanation of the epistles of Paul. If the exegete has specialized in the
dissection and combination of theological concepts, he can point to cohesion
where the ordinary reader thought he saw the opposite. If on the other hand
interpreter has made a special study of psychology then he can see in exactly
those strange jumps and transitions the evidence that you have caught nature
red handed. Of course it is the nature of a very extraordinary man;
extraordinary especially because of his lively, mobile, erratic and humorous
personality which he, in his naive and guileless way, instantly and
unmistakably reveals in his artless pieces of art.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_9" title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In truth: once the person of Paul has emerged from these epistles with all his
imposing peculiarity&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that living ensemble of religious notions, emotions and
motives to which we are used to ascribe historical reality&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then it is
relatively easy to resign ourselves to accept many an inexplicable detail that
seems to disrupt unity and cohesion. And we can resign ourselves more quickly
to these inconcinnities when we consider firstly that these epistles are the
only documents that are witnesses to the events discussed in them, and secondly
that besides his many eminent gifts the writer had little to no literary
talent. These two features lead us to demand rather little in the way of unity
and cohesion from this writer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Who can say whether very extraordinary events and very peculiar circumstances
did not force him to deviate from the normal path in places, to suddenly cut
short his train of thought, and in that way have the appearance of
inconsistency and internal contradiction to us, the uninformed? What do we
really know about the situation in Galatia, in Jerusalem, in Antioch, in
Corinth, in Rome, where the first readers of these epistles lived? Who can tell
us what disruptive influences were at work when these epistles were created,
and who ensures us that the Apostle was not just easily distracted when he was
writing correspondence? Enough: when we start with the assumption that the
person who wrote these Epistles was none other than the eventually to be
world-famous man of Tarsus whose life was a sequence of the most striking
transitions, the most touching meetings, the most painful trials, the most
memorable acts of heroism, then we are not merely prepared to encounter odd
phenomena that deviate from the normal course of events but we will in fact
consider the peculiar and unusual to be only fitting and natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It does not appear to be superfluous to take this moment to point out a few
facts that were taken from the history of criticism of Paul. The things the
practitioners of this scholarship described as natural and plausible! How was
it possible that for centuries they managed to build up a biography of Paul and
a system of Pauline theology from the most heterogeneous components of the New
Testament? What self-confidence was on display when harmonizers obtained the
same Paul from the story of Acts as from the 13 or 14 Pauline epistles! For how
long did they believe in the Paulinism of the 13 epistles as the product of a
single religious thinker! We who have the advantage of the lessons of Semler,
Baur and Zeller consider it impossible that scholarship would ever return to
the thankless task of constructing the historical Paul and his theology from
the 13 canonical Pauline epistles and Acts as if these were all equally
authentic documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But meanwhile as long as men such as Pfleiderer and Hilgenfeld, to name no
further names, cannot be satisfied with just the four epistles that were
rescued from the Tübingen fire, it won&#8217;t surprise us much that a critic like
Bruno Bauer found no one who would listen to his concerns about the
authenticity of these four. Doesn&#8217;t it seem eminently wise to avoid bringing
forth new questions as long as we have not yet dealt with the old ones? What,
one can ask, is the true power of the criticism of Baur? What is the only fixed
positive starting point in this destructive movement? What else than the very
impressive image and the clearly marked aspect of the Paul of the four
Hauptbriefe? If we reject this salt as tasteless, what shall we use as salt? If
we doubt the purity of the gold that has appeared from the Tübingen crucible,
where then can we go to discover the real Paul?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we carefully consider the present state of the Pauline question we have to
note a few facts from which it can be shown that the authenticity and integrity
of the supposedly authentic epistles is indeed not an axiom, even for scholars
who do not want to go along with Bruno Bauer. I am thinking of the last
chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, about the question of the 3rd Epistle to
the Corinthians in connection to the Four Chapter Hypothesis of Hausrath. But I
also think about the still unresolved matter of the origin of the Christian
community in Rome and how we should characterize the readers to whom our
canonical Epistle to the Romans was addressed. Finally I am also thinking of
the newest debates among the exegetes and their mounting disagreement about the
meaning of Galatians 2.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This all points at a haze that prevents us from penetrating into Apostolic
antiquity. With some consideration other important questions appear which are
directed connected to the interpretation of the four Hauptbriefe if indeed we
take them as utterances by the same Paul. Seen from a great distance, a group
of mountains can appear as a single mountainous mass. What will be the result
of our investigation if we look at the four epistles from close up and properly
take into account the spirit that emanates from each one, the historical
background that they presuppose, the relationship of the writers to Judaism and
paganism and so on? Everyone knows that the writer of Romans is rather more
friendly towards Jews and Jewish Christians than the writer of Galatians. It is
also well-known that the tone towards the Pillars, or put otherwise, the
"excessively great" apostles that is struck in the Epistle to the Galatians as
well as in 2nd Corinthians sounds hard and sharp whereas 1st Corinthians has an
atmosphere of reconciliation and tolerance towards the men after which those in
Corinth named themselves as not "of Paul". It would not do to call into
question the identity of these writers on the ground of this one difference.
But if we take into consideration what value is attached in these documents to
apostleship as a mandate of Christ then as soon as we seriously start to ask
ourselves who or what Paul was according to these ancient documents, we would
have to recognize that this difference is important enough to deserve our
attention.</p>

S&#8217;il eut pris une heure de réflexion, on peut douter qu&#8217;il l&#8217;eut laissée partir." This "Paul expédia la lettre sur-le-champ" is typical. Would you not say that Renan had discovered new memoirs of Paul from which he could obtain this and other particularities? The method is seductive. If in the Pauline epistles you run into errors against grammar, logic and common sense it is unnecessary to worry about the question: how can the text be cleansed of these mistakes? You simply leave them in and account for them with some imagined accidental quirk of this extraordinary apostle. Then it is (pg 231): "Le style de Paul est le plus personnel qu&#8217;il y ait jamais eu. La langue y est, si j&#8217;ose le dire, broyée: pas une phrase suivie. Il est impossible de violer plus audacieusement, je me dis pa le génie de la language Grecque, mais la logique du langage humain; on dirait une rapide conversation sténographiée et reproduite sans corrections." Indeed you can go far with such fictions. But the fruitful hypothesis of an apostle who when he gives dictation makes a mockery of all laws of language and style is not enough to explain all the phenomena in this peculiar literature. First we got: the mistakes stayed in the text because the epistles were not proofread, and a moment later Renan tells us that the extraordinary apostle had the habit to deviate from his habit. "Quelquefois <em>(pg. 232)</em>, quand la lettre était finie, il la relisait; son âme impétueuse l&#8217;emportait alors; il y faisait des additions marginales, au risque de briser le contexte et de produire des phrases suspendues ou enchevêtrées. IL envoyait la lettre ainsi raturée, sans se soucier des innombrables répétitions de mots e d&#8217;idées qu&#8217;elle contenait."

<a href="#_footnoteref_9">9</a>. Peculiar in this regard is the character of Paul&#8217;s vibrant personality as it appears to us in his quasi-improvised epistle, as described by many scholars. Max Krenkel for instance says: "Aus jedem Satze hören wir den lauten Schlag seines bewegten Herzens heraus, das ihm &#8230;&#8203; Worte voll niederschmetternder Macht und voll einschmeichelnder Zärtlichkeit eingab &#8230;&#8203; Donner auf Donner, immer majestätischer, Blitz auf Blitz, ein jeder zündend, bis endlich der Himmel&#8230;&#8203; sein wolkenlos Antlitz zeigt, etc." That is what according to Krenkel unprejudiced people notice when they read the Pauline epistles. Krenkel&#8217;s words when I was reminded of them by Prins also gave me the impression of thunder and lightning but to be clear: of the way these natural phenomena are imitated in an amateur stage play.
