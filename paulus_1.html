<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some years now questions have been raised about the authenticity of Paul&#8217;s
Hauptbriefe, and with this also about the history of Paulinism in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would like to make some contributions to answering these questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first contribution is dedicated to an investigation of what can be and is
allowed to be derived from the Acts of the Apostles independently of the
Epistles for our knowledge of Paul and the movement named after him. It seemed
to be especially desirable to me to investigate this: both with an eye on the
presumed inauthenticity of all the Pauline epistles, and because it seems to me
that the witness of Acts regarding Paul has not yet been properly explored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the older school, Acts and the Epistles were simply used together.
"Apparent" contradictions were ignored or cleverly harmonized. In the worst
case Acts and the Epistles were, silently, each in turn, invited to take
precedence over the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Slowly this has changed and Paul has become the person in whom everyone places
trust over Luke. Under the influence of the leaders and disciples of the
Tuebingen school the authenticity of the Epistles became a weapon against every
contradictory report in Acts, while usually everything that didn&#8217;t contradict,
or didn&#8217;t appear to contradict, Paul&#8217;s own statements was considered to be
historically correct and thus was included in the "life of Paul". Although J.W.
Straatman in this respect was resistant against the arbitrariness of Baur and
those of like mind, he in turn did the same himself. In the end he too held to
what seemed plausible to him in Acts that was also in agreement with what the
Epistles had told him regarding Paul, while he rejected everything else as
unreliable. Most meanwhile followed the less decisive judgment made in
Tuebingen about Acts; though it became a judgment of sharp condemnation as soon
as it concerned a contradiction with the Epistles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this too the last years have brought change. The publication of new ideas
about the development of earliest Christianity by A.D. Loman was an attempt to
restore the reputation of Acts at the same time. Loman&#8217;s "Quaestiones Paulinae"
repeatedly stated that this work gives us a more accurate picture of Paul than
the Epistles, although it may not be an entirely correct representation in all
cases. It was an opinion shared by Rudolf Steck, who recommended it explicitly
in his "Galaterbrief".<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>. Since then there is the danger&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;although it was
not the intention of Loman and Steck to work towards this&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that without a
reasonable opposition, Acts, independent of the Epistles, will be considered to
as a reasonably reliable source for our knowledge of Paul&#8217;s life and works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or is it in fact inappropriate to speak of a danger because we are, perhaps,
actually moving in the right direction?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following pages attempt to give the answer to that question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No one could disagree that in the present circumstances an investigation is
very desirable into what Acts reports about Paul independently of the Epistles.
But this investigation needs to be performed independently of our judgment
concerning the authenticity or inauthenticity of any of the Epistles that have
come to us as written by Paul. In fact it will in many cases not be possible to
make noteworthy progress if we do not possess a decent theory concerning the
origin of Acts. And exactly in this respect I believe I have to diverge from
common interpretation; sometimes even rather widely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to avoid having to interrupt the investigation repeatedly to deal with
so-called introductory questions I first wish to discuss the origin of Acts.
After this I can then more succinctly deal with what Acts, independently of the
Epistles, can tell us about Paul. I flatter myself that in this way we create a
path to surprising results and ensure ourselves invaluable support for our
further investigations regarding Paulinism. But we should not go too far ahead
in these matters. The judgment concerning this stays with the interested
reader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a followup to this publication about Paul that forms a certain whole with
this first one, I wish to concern myself with the Epistle to the Romans.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_i_the_unity_of_the_work">I. The unity of the work.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A single glance at the contents of Acts is sufficient to convince us that we
are not looking at the work of a single eye and ear witness. We hear in turn
about the experiences of Jesus' first disciples after his resurrection and
ascension, about Peter and Paul, about Philip and Barnabas, about Stephen and
James, about Jews and Christians in Jerusalem, in Antioch, in Rome, and
elsewhere. Repeatedly the author shares details that would have taken place at
about the same time but in different locations. It is impossible to imagine
someone who was present for all of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there can also be no doubt about the unity of the work. It can in no way be
considered to be a coincidental collection of different stories and episodes
that have their origins with different individuals. It&#8217;s also not a simple
sequence of material taken from different traditions or written documents. It
is still common to incorrectly interpret Acts 1:8 as the indication of the plan
or program of the author, while in this passage Jesus speaks strictly to the
eleven. Paul&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or more correctly, first Paul and Barnabas, then Paul and Silas
or Paul by himself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;contributed no less to the dissemination of the Gospel in
Acts 13-28. It&#8217;s also doubtful whether Rome could be designated "the end of the
Earth" and Acts in any case does not relate anything about the foundation of
Christianity in Rome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But even then it must be recognized: there is a common thread throughout the
whole work. It gives us a fairly coherent sketch of the history of Christianity
during the first years after the death of Jesus. While this sketch may be far
from complete, it does offer us a rather well-organized whole in which there is
certainly no jarring discontinuity between topics. The demands of chronology
have been taken into account fairly well as much as they penetrated into the
awareness of the author. Very gradually stories follow each other:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The last meeting of Jesus with the disciples; the ascension of the Master;
the disposition of the waiting disciples and the addition of Matthew to the
twelve. (Acts 1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pouring out of the holy spirit on Pentecost and the direct impact of this
momentous event, concluding with a brief sketch of the first community. (Acts
2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The activity of Peter and John in the temple in Jerusalem, their capture,
interrogation and release, again concluding with a memory of the excellent
qualities of the oldest community. (Acts 3, Acts 4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sad history of Ananias and Sapphira, the further activity of the apostles
in Jerusalem, the support they enjoyed and the opposition that they experience.
(Acts 5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appointing of deacons, the activity and martyr&#8217;s death of Stephen. (Acts
6, Acts 7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A persecution of Christians in Jerusalem, the flight of many to the countries
of Judea and Samaria, the activity there of Philip, and soon also of Peter and
John, and the connected history of Simon Magus. (Acts 8)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversion of Paul, his activity as preacher of the Gospel, his becoming
acquainted with the Jerusalem Christians. (Acts 9.1-31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The further work of Peter outside Jerusalem, in particular in Lydda, Joppe
and Caesarea, where he receives the god-fearing gentile Cornelius into the
Christian community, a deed for which he gives a proper accounting in Jerusalem.
(Acts 9:32-11:18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The origin of a community from gentiles in Antioch, which is in part a result
of the diaspora of Christians after the death of Stephen and her interaction
with the parent community in Jerusalem. (Acts 11.19-29)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Herod&#8217;s activity against the Christians, how he has James killed, Peter
captured, and how he dies a painful death himself. (Acts 12.1-23)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The return of Barnabas and Saul, mentioned at the end of Acts 11. (Acts
12.24; Acts 25)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their apostolic journeys to Cyprus and Asia Minor. (Acts 13-14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meeting of Paul and Barnabas with the apostles and elders in Jerusalem,
necessitated by circumstances. (Acts 15:1-35)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The further fate of Paul until the end of his two year captivity in Rome.
(Acts 15.36-28.31)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An eye is kept on the coherence of facts that aren&#8217;t mentioned in immediate
sequence; for instance the connection between the persecution of Christians in
Jerusalem, mentioned in 8.1, and the founding of a gentile-Christian community
in Antioch in 11.19-20, and between the staying behind of Silas and Timothy in
17.14-15 and their return to Paul in 18.5. When the coherence is broken, as in
11.30, it is deliberately restored in 12.25. Philip in Caesarea (21.8) and the
Ephesian Trophimus (21.29) are old acquaintances of the author, which is also
evidenced by 8.40 and 20.4. Repeatedly we find the author calling back to
details that were related earlier (11.16 to 1.5; 11.19 to 8.1; 15.8 to
11.44-47; 15.38 to 13.13; 16.4 to 15.29; 19.1 to 18.23; 22.20 to 7.58 and 8.1)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is momentum in the course of the related history. We see Christianity,
initially limited to a small circle of the faithful (1) expand itself, first
within the narrow boundaries of Jerusalem (2-7), after this in other parts of
Judea, in Samaria (8); founded amongst former Jews in Damascus (9), brought to
the god-fearing gentile Cornelius in Caesarea (10.1-11.18), to ordinary Greeks,
non-Jewish, in Antioch (11.19-26), and finally frequently to Jews and gentiles
wherever they may live the civilized world, in such a way that its actual
destiny for the gentiles becomes clear (13-28). The Gospel for Jews and
god-fearers, for Samaritans and gentiles! The parent community and her
representatives, the apostles, gradually start to acknowledge this. Their
outlook becomes increasingly liberal, and their perspective widens. Before the
outpouring of the holy spirit takes place they believe they can take as a
witness only one of the men who was a close acquaintance of Lord Jesus
(1.21-22). Later on entirely different people are acknowledged and praised as
"prophets and teachers" (13.1) for their efforts to spread the Gospel among the
gentiles, among them some men from Cyprus and Cyrene (11.20) as well as "the
apostles" Barnabas and Paul (14.14). When  the story reaches Jerusalem for the
first time that Samaritans have accepted the word of God, Peter and John are
dispatched to see what is going on (8.14-15). When Peter is moved, not without
difficulty, to go to the god-fearing Cornelius, and reaches out to him and then
makes a report of his missionary work in Jerusalem, they don&#8217;t just accept what
happened, but actually take it as an occasion to praise God (11.18). Barnabas,
dispatched by the community in Jerusalem to investigate the circumstances of
the conversion of gentiles in Antioch, goes one step further. He rejoices,
fetches Paul from Tarsus and for one year dedicates himself with Paul to the
expansion of the community of Christians from the gentiles in Antioch
(11.22-26). Later those in Jerusalem take up the fight for both of them
(15.6-29), and finally they receive Paul and those with him "gladly", while
they do their best to protect the brothers from any difficulty (21.17-25).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s possible to speak of the work as consisting of two parts,
one so-called Petrine (1-12), and one Pauline (13-28), because Peter is indeed
the main character in the most important stories of the first, and Paul in the
second. But these two parts are not simply independent from each other; they
interlock. You only have to look at how the Pauline reference to Barbanas
(4.36-37), the matter concerning Stephen&#8217;s actions and death (6.8-15 and
7.51-8.3a), the story of Paul&#8217;s conversion and the events that are immediately
connected to it (9.1-30), as well the story of foundation of a community from
gentiles in Antioch (11.10-30 and 12.24-25), have each retained a position in
the first part, while in turn the definitely non-Pauline story of the council
of Jerusalem (15.1-35) is contained in the second part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This second book by Luke, as we call its author for convenience, forms a fairly
finished whole no less than his first work, our third Gospel. In addition to
the overview that has already been supplied we should also pay attention to the
introduction (1.1-2). Let it not go unnoticed that the book only has the
appearance of being unfinished. It is said: the story of Paul is suddenly
broken off. But then we fail to see that the author has indeed ended his story
by making the reader feel much earlier that Paul is going to die in Rome
(20.22-24; 21.4; 21.11-14; 27.23-24). Why then wouldn&#8217;t he tell us again
clearly at the end of the book? He also doesn&#8217;t he give us the reason why he
lets Peter, just saved from prison, retire permanently (except for his
necessary appearance in Acts 15) with the remark "and he departed to another
place". Perhaps there is a connection between the one and the other and he did
not wish to describe Paul&#8217;s martyr death because the tradition did not speak of
a violent death for Peter. But the most plausible explanation is that he didn&#8217;t
mention the bloody end of the apostle to the gentiles because he didn&#8217;t want to
antagonize the Romans while it was actually his aim to win their favor for
Christianity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[#page-10-and-11] His persistent pursuit of that target is also evidence for
the unity of the work. As J. W. Straatman.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> and H. U.
Meiboom.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> have
conclusively proven, after Overbeck.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>, Rovers.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup> and others, following Schneckenburger and Zeller
who had drawn attention to this point in passing: everything is set up to the
defense of Christianity in the Roman world and to uphold their right to exist
in it. With the Jews they are finished; they have to be spared no longer.
Although Christianity is nothing but the lawful continuation of the best of
what Israel possessed, the Jews have, to their shame, rejected it. The author
does not tire of arguing this, by mouth of Peter on the first day of Pentecost
(2.14-36), in the Jerusalem temple (3.11-26), before the Sanhedrin (4.8-12 and
5.29-32), to Cornelius in Caesarea (10.34-43), by mouth of Stephen shortly
before his death (7.2-53), Paul against the leaders of the synagogue in Antioch
in Pisidia (13.16-41). None of these speakers neglects to make clear that the
Romans did not crucify Jesus, although Pilate gave his permission for it, but
that those guilty of the death of this innocent are none other than the Jews,
who are accused of this repeatedly (2.23; 3.14; 4.10; 5.30; 7.52; 10.39;
13.28). They have displayed their deep contempt of the "Way", which they call a
sect (αἵρεσις) (24.14), by mocking the work of the holy spirit (2.13), by first
imprisoning Peter and John (4.1-4) and then the apostles (5.18), by killing
Stephen (7.59), by the persecution of the community in Jerusalem (8.1), by the
deliberation against Paul in Damascus (9.23-25), by their resistance against
him and Barnabas in Antioch in Pisidia (13.45; 13.50), in Iconium (14.2), by
stoning Paul in Lystra (14.19), by plotting against him and causing difficulty
in his evangelizing in Thessalonica (17.5), in Beroea (17.13), in Corinth
(18.6), in Ephesus (19.9), in Greece (20.3); by trying to kill him in Jerusalem
(21.27-32), by becoming the cause of his capture and conveyance to Rome
(21-28); and finally by showing their aversion to him there as well (28.23-28).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Romans however, our historian argues continuously, had their eyes opened
from the start to the value of Christianity and did not hesitate to give it
their protection. Romans were among the first witnesses of the working of the
holy spirit in Jerusalem (2.10). The first gentile converted by Peter was the
noble Roman Cornelius in Caesarea, for whose sake the apostle travels and
receives supernatural revelations (Acts 10). Similarly the first named
individual who Paul won over to his view of the Gospel is a Roman official, the
proconsul Sergius Paulus in Paphos on Cyprus (13.4-12). The Romans never engage
in any persecution. Their contribution to the death of Jesus is actually put on
the account of the Jews, as we have already seen. King Herod retained enough
independence to kill a few of them under his own authority, including James,
and, to please the Jews, imprison Peter (12.1-5). When the Roman government
ends up imprisoning Paul and Silas in Philippi, it happens on the instigation
of low individuals out for dirty profit, who were not ashamed to make false
accusations (16.19-24). But barely have these gentlemen thought a little about
what happened and heard who were captured on their orders, and they give the
order to release them, indeed they even rush to the jail, take them out and
request politely that they leave the city (16.35-39). In Corinth the proconsul
Gallio refuses to consider a complaint against Paul, in whom he found no
wrongdoing nor any crime (18.14-16). In Ephesus the town clerk takes up his
defense (19.37). In Jerusalem, Lysias, the tribune of the cohort, takes him
into temporary custody, in part due to a misunderstanding, in part to prevent
worse from happening (21.31-40). The conveyance of the prisoner to Caesarea,
under a particularly strong guard, has no other purpose than to protect Paul&#8217;s
life, which is under threat (23.22-33). Lysias charges him with nothing that
deserves death or imprisonment (23.29). Felix apparently doesn&#8217;t consider him
guilty of any crime either (24.22-23). Festus doesn&#8217;t want to convict him
without a hearing, nor send him against his will to Jerusalem (25.1-9). He
declares to Agrippa that he can find nothing against the prisoner, which
bothers him now that he has to send him to Rome (25.24-27). The king of the
Jews, Agrippa, whose impartiality as a judge cannot be in doubt, agrees
entirely with the Roman governor (26.31-32). What could be more powerful
evidence of the innocence of Paul? He is only sent to Rome because he appealed
to the emperor. But although he is a prisoner, he has freedom of movement
aboard the ship. The centurion of the imperial cohort, Julius, gives Paul
special treatment, rather more than makes sense (27.3, 27.11, 27.43). After the
shipwreck he heals the father of Publius and other sick on Malta, who of course
gratefully revere him (28.8-10). In Rome at last, his imprisonment is extremely
light (28.16-30) and it&#8217;s repeated that the Romans actually wanted to release
him because they could not find any guilt in him (28.17-18). In these ways it
is argued that Christianity is not evil, and does no evil, even though "people
everywhere are speaking against this sect" (28.22). Those Romans empowered to
act and judge have acknowledged this all along. Why should one now behave
differently against those whose great apostle, who moved amongst the gentiles,
after all himself was a Roman citizen?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This attribution of Roman citizenship to Paul (16.37), and also to Silas,
cannot be explained at all from a historical perspective but is of great
importance in the history of Paul in Acts (see 16.21; 16.37; 16:38; 22.25-29;
23.27; 25.10-11; 26.32; 28.19). It is an eloquent plea against the persecution
that Christians had to fear or endure from Romans. This continuous endeavour of
Luke to defend Christianity in front of the Romans, a characteristic of Acts on
which O. Pfleiderer.footnote[Das Urchristenthum, seine Schriften und Lehren,
1887, pg. 544-7 and 602] recently put a lot of emphasis, is therefore probably
the reason why no deliberate reference is made here to the violent death that
Paul according to tradition underwent in Rome. Such an ending would be in too
cutting a contradiction with the intended aim.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The unity of the work becomes equally visible by the spirit which permeates it.
It&#8217;s the same throughout as well: a spirit of earnestness and peace, of truth
and love, of tolerance and appreciation. There is only one exception to this
rule and this exception too keeps recurring. This involves the Jews. They are
continuously attacked severely, for the position of the author allows no
alternatives. Because he stands firm in the conviction: the Jews could have
received Jesus and Christianity, but have deliberately rejected the founder and
what he founded. See also the references on <a href="#page-10-and-11">page 10 and 11</a>
and also note how Paul angrily turns his back to the Jews each time and says:
they are to blame that he has to go to the gentiles now (13.46; 18.6; 19.9;
28.25-28).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a friendly mood and a gentle judgment for everyone else, inside and
outside the boundaries of the Christian community, as long as they&#8217;re not
convicted sinners like Judas, Ananias and Sapphira, Simon Magus and Elymas. The
book is very pleased with Christianity, irregardless in what form it appears,
older or newer. Petrism nor Paulinism do not speak here, to use familiar
expressions, but rather a spirit of brotherhood between "Peter" and "Paul", a
Catholicism that is on a path of reconciliation. That Peter and those with him
are portrayed first is simply a result of the circumstance that they were
active before Paul and his friends. The oldest leaders aren&#8217;t recognized as
such anymore. Both receive equal honor; the acts of both are justified equally.
It&#8217;s as if there are no differences in direction, as if no development took
place in Christianity. Universalism is not objectionable in the estimation of
Petrism; antinomianism isn&#8217;t a feature of Paulinism alone. The eleven, soon the
twelve, especially Peter and John, and also James, and in general those in
Jerusalem, are to be called "the apostles" par excellence (1.2; 1.26; 2:37;
2.42; 2.43; 4.33; 4.35; 4.6; 5.2; 5.12; 5.18; 5.29, etc); and Paul and Barnabas
are also named as such (14.4; 14.14).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The eleven are promised (1.5, 1.8) and gifted the holy spirit (2.1 and
continued), and Paul the same (9.17). They share it with others (8.15), and he
does too (19.6).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They too are called by Jesus to preach to the ends of the Earth (1.8), and are
conscious of their duty go to the gentiles. Already on the first day of
Pentecost Peter assures his listeners that the promise is to Israel&#8217;s children
καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς εἰς μακρὰν, ὅσους ἂν προσκαλέσηται Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν (and to
all that are far off, all of whom are called by the Lord our God) (2.39). He
approves of Philip&#8217;s preaching among the Samaritans (8.15); he himself recruits
the first gentile, Cornelius; and defends this move (Acts 10-11), and later
calls himself chosen to evangelize amongst the gentiles ἀφ’ ἡμερῶν ἀρχαίων
(from the early days) (15.7). Earlier already those in Jerusalem sent Barnabas
to Antioch and gave their seal of approval to the χάρις τοῦ Θεοῦ (grace of God)
that was visible there amongst the former gentiles (11.23). None of them that
are in authority have any objection against the unjewish activity of Paul and
Barnabas amongst the gentiles, even when this topic is deliberately brought up
(Acts 15). The universalism and consecration of the holy spirit are no
innovations by Paul or one of his kindred spirits. They are as old as
Christianity itself, specifically as old as as the activity of Peter and his
friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand Paul is not portrayed as hostile, with a sharp-edged
antinomianism and as solely lead by the holy spirit, to the brothers of the
parent community. He is rather taught immediately after his conversion by
Ananias, who belongs to the older Christians; baptized and acquainted with the
apostles in Jerusalem, where, so, to speak, he pops in regularly (9.1-30);
fetched from Tarsus to Antioch by Barnabas, the trusted member of the Jerusalem
community, who put him to work (11.26). Paul accompanies the capable preacher
on his journeys as a second person, first to Jerusalem, to serve the brothers
(11.30) and subsequently to Cyprus and through Asia Minor to preach the gospel
(Acts 13-14). Only slowly he becomes the first and Barnabas steps into his
shadow. In Antioch he belongs to those who "serve the Lord and fast" (13.2). He
doesn&#8217;t speak to gentiles as a rule, unless the Jews force him to do so by
their unwillingness. He is in a lively communion with the parent community from
the start. He visits it continuously (9.26; 11.30; 15.2; 18.22, 21.15); helps
with its relief (11.30); subjects himself to its pronouncements (15.1-35); does
what it asks (9.30; 11.25; 16.1-4; 21.20-26); and continuously he shows himself
to be full of reverence for the Law and its institutions and practices (16.1-4;
21.20-26; 23.2-5). What may still seem new in his actions can&#8217;t rightfully
offend, because it is prepared by the activities of others: by Stephen
(6.11-14), by Philip amongst Samaritans and with the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8),
by some men of Cyprus and Cyrene in Antioch (11.20) and by Peter with Cornelius
(Acts 10). He can therefore easily declare in front of the Sanhedrin that he&#8217;s
always had a good conscience (23.1), that he isn&#8217;t persecuted for
antinomianism, but περὶ ἐλπίδος καὶ ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν (for the hope and the
resurrection of the dead) (23.6). He declares in front of Felix that he
traveled to Jerusalem "to worship" (24.11). He has done nothing offensive in
the temple, in the synagogues or in the city (24.12, compare 24.6). He even
believes in all that is written in Law and Prophets (24.14), and has returned
after many years to Jerusalem to deliver alms and offerings, for which he had
purified himself and gone to the temple (24.17-18). Before Festus he repeats
the assertion that he had done nothing evil against the Jews (25.10). He and
Agrippa hear that his preaching has always been accordance with the predictions
of Moses and the Prophets (26.22-23). He says the same to the Jews in Rome:
that he has never done anything against "the people or customs of our fathers"
(28.17).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally we can add the witness of language and style to all this evidence for
the unity of Acts. These too are generally the same in the entire book, even
where different individuals speak. They betray a single hand. What
Zeller.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup> and others, the most completely C.
Nösgen, in his "Commentar über die AG (1882), have pointed out as
particularities does not need to be repeated here. Nobody in the present day
will hold Acts, with Schleiermacher and Schwanbeck, to be a simple collection
of fragments taken from different sources. The book is a unity in form and
content, the work of a single author.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This declaration should be empathized to prevent misunderstanding as well as to
make us realize how difficult it will always remain to give a complete overview
of the nature and scope of the tools that the author used when composing his
work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We cannot doubt the unity of the work. We are dealing with a book and not a
simple collection of traditions and fragments. But it does not follow from this
that we can now consider Acts to be, with Bruno Bauer.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>, a "Werk
der Dichtung und Reflexion" (a work of poetry and reflection) which contains at
most a few correct traditions concerning Paul&#8217;s journeys, but certainly not
"Notizen oder Denkschriften über die Urzeit der Gemeinde und über die
Geschichte des Heidenapostels" (notes or memoranda about the early days of the
community and about the history of the apostle to the gentiles), while the
miracles assigned to Peter and Paul are "absichtlich under mit vollem
Bewusstsein den Wunderberichten der Evangelien nachgebilded" (intentional
imitations with full awareness of the reports of miracles in the gospels) and
all participating individuals "Geschöpfe" (creations), "freie Schöpfung" (free
creation) by the author. Nor should we now revert with C. Nösgen to the opinion
of the ancients, who did not consider written sources to explain the origin of
Acts, because Luke could have taken from tradition all that he didn&#8217;t
experience himself as eye and wear witness. Bleek-Mangold.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_8" title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup> has sufficiently corrected him as well as C. Schmidt, who maintained the
same while considering Acts 13-28 in the first part of his "Apostelgeschichte"
(1882). The recognition of the unity of the work does not release us from the
obligation to perform an intentional investigation into its composition.</p>
